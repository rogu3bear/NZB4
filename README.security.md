# Security Review and Recommendations for Universal Media Converter

This document outlines security considerations for the Universal Media Converter application when running in a local environment.

## Security Improvements Implemented

The following security improvements have been implemented in the application:

1. **Input Validation and Sanitization**
   - All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent command injection
   - File uploads are validated for type and size
   - Path traversal protection via path normalization and validation

2. **Resource Monitoring and Limits**
   - CPU and memory usage monitoring for conversion processes
   - Automatic termination of processes exceeding resource limits
   - Disk space checking before starting jobs

3. **Error Handling**
   - Improved error handling and messaging
   - Proper HTTP status codes for error conditions
   - Custom error pages to prevent information leakage

4. **File Safety**
   - Safe file name handling using secure_filename
   - Path validation to ensure files are within allowed directories
   - Prevention of path traversal attacks

5. **Job Management**
   - Job cancellation and retry functionality
   - Automatic cleanup of old jobs to prevent memory leaks
   - Thread-safe job status updates with mutex locks

## Recommended Additional Security Measures

When using this application, consider the following additional security measures:

1. **Docker Security**
   - Run the Docker container with limited privileges
   - Consider using `--security-opt no-new-privileges` flag
   - Limit container resource usage with Docker's resource constraints

2. **Volume Permissions**
   - Ensure host volumes mounted to the container have appropriate permissions
   - Consider using read-only mounts where possible

3. **Network Configuration**
   - Limit the application to localhost (127.0.0.1) if not needed on the network
   - If network access is needed, consider using a reverse proxy with TLS

4. **File System Considerations**
   - Keep the application in a separate partition or disk from important data
   - Implement disk quotas to prevent disk space exhaustion

5. **Regular Maintenance**
   - Regularly update the Docker image to get security patches
   - Monitor logs for suspicious activity
   - Keep backups of configuration files

## Known Limitations

1. The application has no user authentication, as it's designed for local use only.
2. The application does not implement CSRF protection as it's assumed to run in a trusted environment.
3. The media conversion process depends on external tools that may have their own security vulnerabilities.

## Running Securely on a Local Machine

To run the application with maximum security on a local machine:

```bash
# Run with limited network exposure (localhost only)
docker-compose up -d

# Access the application only from the local machine
http://localhost:5000
```

For additional security, consider running behind a reverse proxy with authentication if access from other machines is required.
